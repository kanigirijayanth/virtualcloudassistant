# Virtual Cloud Assistant Optimization Summary

## Problem
The Nova Sonic agent was hanging after 5-6 questions due to memory accumulation and connection overload.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Context Memory Management
- **Added message limits**: Limited conversation context to last 20 messages
- **Location**: `main.py` - `OpenAILLMContext(max_messages=20)`
- **Impact**: Prevents unlimited memory growth from conversation history

### 2. Memory Monitoring & Garbage Collection
- **Added memory monitoring**: Tracks memory usage every 5 interactions
- **Added forced garbage collection**: Runs `gc.collect()` every 5 interactions
- **Added memory warnings**: Alerts when memory usage exceeds 80%
- **Location**: `main.py` - `handle_transcript_update()` function
- **Dependencies**: Added `psutil>=5.9.0` to requirements.txt

### 3. Heartbeat Audio Optimization
- **Reduced frequency**: Changed heartbeat intervals from 2s/3s/5s to 5s/5s/5s
- **Better cleanup**: Improved heartbeat task cancellation and cleanup
- **Location**: `custom_nova_sonic.py` - `_send_heartbeat_audio()` method
- **Impact**: Reduces WebSocket connection overload

### 4. Timeout Protection
- **Added 30-second timeout**: Prevents knowledge base queries from hanging indefinitely
- **Added timeout handling**: Graceful error handling for timed-out queries
- **Location**: `custom_nova_sonic.py` - `wrapped_func()` with `asyncio.wait_for()`
- **Impact**: Prevents system from hanging on slow/stuck queries

### 5. Credential Refresh Optimization
- **Added caching**: Only refresh credentials every 5 minutes instead of every connection
- **Reduced API calls**: Prevents rate limiting from ECS metadata endpoint
- **Location**: `main.py` - `update_dredentials()` function
- **Impact**: Reduces credential-related failures

### 6. Connection Cleanup
- **Enhanced disconnect handling**: Proper cleanup of heartbeat tasks and memory
- **Added forced cleanup**: Garbage collection on client disconnect
- **Location**: `main.py` - `on_client_disconnected()` handler
- **Impact**: Prevents resource leaks between sessions

## Expected Results

### Before Optimization:
- System hangs after 5-6 questions
- Memory accumulation without cleanup
- Aggressive heartbeat causing connection issues
- No timeout protection
- Frequent credential refresh calls

### After Optimization:
- Stable operation for extended conversations
- Controlled memory usage with monitoring
- Reduced connection overhead
- Timeout protection prevents hanging
- Efficient credential management
- Better resource cleanup

## Monitoring

The system now provides:
- Memory usage logging every 5 interactions
- Memory warnings when usage exceeds 80%
- Heartbeat task status logging
- Timeout event logging
- Credential refresh timing logs

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Extended Conversation Test**: Have 15-20 question conversation to verify no hanging
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Watch console logs for memory usage patterns
3. **Timeout Testing**: Ask complex questions that might take time to process
4. **Connection Stability**: Test interruptions and reconnections
5. **Resource Cleanup**: Monitor system resources between sessions

## Files Modified

1. `backend/app/main.py` - Main optimizations and memory management
2. `backend/app/custom_nova_sonic.py` - Heartbeat optimization and timeout handling
3. `backend/app/requirements.txt` - Added psutil dependency

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert these files to their previous versions and restart the ECS service.
